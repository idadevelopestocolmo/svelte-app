    <p>The TVmaze app is a responsive first time demo project using Svelte and Tailwind CSS.</p>
    <p>The app is fetching and displaying tv show data from the free TVmaze API, providing additional information about the selected show. It also includes a search field to lookup shows from the database.</p>
    <p>Design inspiration is to aesthetically gimmick the typical user interface of free online streaming services.</p>
